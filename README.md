# To-Do-List 

A JavaScript program based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## Description 

we first define a `Task` class and a `TaskList` class to represent individual tasks and the entire list of tasks.
The `TaskList` class has methods to add, remove, and toggle the completion status of tasks.
We then define a `TaskListView` class to represent the view of the to do list and a `TaskListController` class to handle user input and update the model and view.
